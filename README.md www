Welcome to my first surviv.io weapon concept!

RD-112:

Ammo: 5.56m, Magazine: 35, Fire Mode: Semi-Auto, Reload: 0.85, Speed: 90, Range: 100, Damage: 5.5, Support Dispersion: 6, Movement Dispersion: 6.

How to Get: Soviet Crates, Golden Wall Barrel, Chest, Axe Crate and Meteor Crate. (Only in these specific locations because after the fall of the Soviet Union, the RD-112 stopped being produced)

Special Ability: Rd-112 has the ability to not slow down like any other weapon, which helps you escape a firefight, and has a fast reload system so you can attack the enemy faster and not get hit. And it can be called rebeldust-112 or rod-112

And I'm going to change the Sound because this is a modified sound of the game's normal weapons, but I don't know where to create these sounds yet.
